    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <img src="inuyasha-wallpaper.jpg" alt="Inuyasha characters" width="300" height="225" />
    <p>The series begins with Kagome Higurashi, a 15-year-old schoolgirl from Tokyo who is transported to the Sengoku
        period
        of Japan after falling into a well in her family shrine, where she meets the half dog-demon, Inuyasha. When a
        monster
        from that era tries to take the magical Shikon Jewel embodied in Kagome, she inadvertently shatters the Jewel
        into many
        pieces that are dispersed across Japan. Inuyasha and Kagome start traveling to recover it before the powerful
        and evil
        half spider-demon Naraku finds all the shards. Inuyasha and Kagome gain several allies during their journey,
        including
        Shippo, Miroku, Sango and Kirara. In contrast to the typically comedic nature of much of Takahashi's previous
        work,
        Inuyasha deals with a darker and more serious subject matter, using the setting of the Sengoku period to easily
        display
        the violent content while still retaining some comedic elements. You can learn more at <a role="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuyasha"
